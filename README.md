# Get Blood APP 
#### The app is a Blood app, 16/10/2022
#### **By Kelvin Kipchumba**
## Project Description
    Its a App where you can get blood from any hospital based on blood group.
    
## Setup/Installation Requirements
    - Download a file in the code section to the desired folder
    - Extract the files
    - Open the folder with vs code.
    - Open client folder
    - Then run "npm install" to install react packages.
    - Run "npm start" to start react server, http://127.0.0.1:3000/.
    - The open backend folder and run "bundle install".
    - Run "bundle exec rake server" to open the backend server, http://127.0.0.1:9292/.
    - And you are all done.


## BDD
    As a user should;
    - View Blood groups on landing page.
    - Add Blood group.
    - View, create, update and delete hospitals.
    - Add blood to different hospitals(i.e O, O+, A, B etc) and everytime you add a blood group that exists it increments the amount of blood.
    - In future, I will intergrate the booking feature plus authentication.
